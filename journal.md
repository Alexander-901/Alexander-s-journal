promt: The New Cell Phone Law, opinion?
In my opinion, the cell phone ban seems too "strict". How I use it depends on my work, if i finish my work I'll use it if allowed, if not, I'll not use it. Phone use should be allowed in free time, like lunch or when work is done, or in emergencies. An example of "emergencies" is on August during the first weeks of school when a kid got stabbed, he couldn't call for help as his phone was confiscated and was left there. Phones should be allowed for emergencies or free time as its gone when you really need it. Me personally, nothing feels changed apart from lunch and alerts from my parents, because most of my classes before allowed us to use our phones after work was done, which was mostly at the end of class. I belive the teachers should be allowed to determine phone use, outside of that, phones should be allowed to be used.

Prompt: Describe how computer science could be valuable in a profession youâ€™re interested in.
A career path I'm interested in is animating and I know very well computer science is very important there. Just moving parts alone computer science is very important, as every movement, every frame has to be calculated by you and the computer. Moving stuff through frames isn't all there is however, as special effects, lighting, sound aslo make animating more lively. Animation is a great example of what computer science can do and what it can mke. The beauty of animation is that anyone can do it, from well known examples like disney, sony, and Pixar, to smaller, more indie animations that were done for fun.
