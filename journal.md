promt: The New Cell Phone Law, opinion?
In my opinion, the cell phone ban seems too "strict". How I use it depends on my work, if i finish my work I'll use it if allowed, if not, I'll not use it. Phone use should be allowed in free time, like lunch or when work is done, or in emergencies. An example of "emergencies" is on August during the first weeks of school when a kid got stabbed, he couldn't call for help as his phone was confiscated and was left there. Phones should be allowed for emergencies or free time as its gone when you really need it. Me personally, nothing feels changed apart from lunch and alerts from my parents, because most of my classes before allowed us to use our phones after work was done, which was mostly at the end of class. I belive the teachers should be allowed to determine phone use, outside of that, phones should be allowed to be used.
